# First week

 To start I made a base sketch for the website using exalidraw after I knew then went to make the navbar. The navbar started out pretty bad but after a while I figured out what I wanted and also managed some javascript so that the hamburger menu would changed when clicked. 
 
## Meeting one

That sounds great do you think we could hop on a call? Sometime today or tomorrow so I can know what you want on the website.
